**Deep Learning Applications in 5G RACH Procedure** <br/>
In this project, we will compare resource predictors for minimizing RACH preamble collisions using LSTM and ARIMA. We have used GANs to generate synthetic data for users.

**Contents** <br/>
-> Datasets: User data after synthetic GAN and after prediction for all users combined and different files for all 300 users <br/>
-> Graphs: Outputs of the true and predicted data <br/>
-> GANs: Code to generate synthetic data for users <br/>
